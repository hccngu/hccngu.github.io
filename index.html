<br>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/">East China Normal University (ECNU)</a>, working in the <a
	href="http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/">School of Data Science and Engineering</a>, advised by <a
	href="http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/mgao/index.html">Ming Gao</a> and <a
	href="https://lixiang3776.github.io/">Xiang Li</a>. My research interests lie in few-shot learning for information extraction. I am currently working on <b>few-shot relation classification</b> and <b>few-shot named entity recognition</b>. 

I have interned in the NLP groups at Alibaba (in 2021) and Meituan (in 2022). Previously,
I graduated from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in 2017 with a major in civil aviation engineering.<br><br>

<!--  My bachelor thesis was on deep learning methods
for relation extraction in clinical text, supervised by <a href="http://www.iitg.ac.in/anand.ashish/index.html">Ashish
	Anand</a>.<br><br> -->

When Iâ€™m not doing NLP, I like to work out, play guitar, and read.<br>
