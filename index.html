<br>
I recently completed my PhD at <a href="https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/">East China Normal University (ECNU)</a> in the <a href="http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/">School of Data Science and Engineering</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/mgao/index.html">Ming Gao</a> and <a href="https://lixiang3776.github.io/">Xiang Li</a>.

<p>My current research interests focus on the evaluation and analysis of large language models.</p>

<h4>Industry Experience</h4>
<p>I have gained substantial industry experience through several internships:</p>
<p><ul>
    <li><b>Alibaba (2021):</b> Interned with the NLP group, gaining insights into industry-level NLP applications.</li>
    <li><b>Meituan (2022):</b> Continued my journey with the NLP group, further honing my skills.</li>
    <li><b>Microsoft Xiaoice (Jan-Jun 2023):</b> Focused on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.</li>
    <li><b>Ant Group (Jun-Oct 2023):</b> Researched techniques to mitigate hallucinations in large language models.</li>
    <li><b>Shanghai AI Lab (Oct 2023-May 2024):</b> Concentrated on developing AI Agents for operating systems.</li>
    <li><b>Meituan (Since Jul 2024):</b> Full-time researcher.</li>
</ul></p>

<h4>Join My Team</h4>
<p>I'm currently on the lookout for interns interested in large model evaluation and analysis. If you're ready to dive into this exciting field, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:hccngu@163.com">hccngu@163.com</a>. Let's explore the future of AI together!</p>

<h4>Personal Interests</h4>
<p>When I'm not doing NLP, I like to work out, play guitar, and read.</p>
